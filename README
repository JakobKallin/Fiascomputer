The architecture of this app is experimental, intended to keep different parts
of the app as isolated as possible and to allow the HTML and CSS to define the
app's appearance without being closely tied to the JavaScript implementation.
Many parts of the app could be refactored to make the code easier to work with.
The online functionality in particular was added quickly and should be
refactored before being expanded.
